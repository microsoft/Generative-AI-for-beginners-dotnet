Welcome to **Generative AI for Beginners .NET**, the hands-on course for .NET developers diving into the world of Generative AI!

This isn‚Äôt your typical ‚Äúhere‚Äôs some theory, good luck‚Äù course. This repository is all about **real-world applications** and **live coding** to empower .NET developers to take full advantage of Generative AI.

This is **hands-on**, **practical**, and designed to be **fun**!

Don't forget to [star (üåü) this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/saving-repositories-with-stars) to find it easier later.

‚û°Ô∏èGet your own copy by [Forking this repo](https://github.com/microsoft/Generative-AI-for-beginners-dotnet/fork) and find it next in your own repositories.

## ‚ú® What's New

We're constantly improving this course with the latest AI tools, models, and practical samples:

- **ÔøΩ New! Basic Chat App for OpenAI gpt-oss Model!**

  Try out our new [Basic Chat application](./03-CoreGenerativeAITechniques/src/BasicChat-07Ollama-gpt-oss) designed to test the [OpenAI gpt-oss model](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-oss/). This sample demonstrates how to use the latest open-source model from OpenAI in a .NET console app, making it easy to experiment with conversational AI locally or in the cloud.

- **üñºÔ∏è Hugging Face MCP Server Image Generation Samples!**

  Explore new C# console app samples that show how to use the Hugging Face MCP Server to generate images directly from your code.

  - [Try the sample using GitHub Models or Azure AI Foundry](./03-CoreGenerativeAITechniques/src/MCP-01-HuggingFace/Program.cs)
  - [Use Ollama for local model inference](./03-CoreGenerativeAITechniques/src/MCP-02-HuggingFace-Ollama/Program.cs)

- **üïπÔ∏è Apps Generated with AI**

  We're excited to introduce a new section featuring full applications generated with AI tools like GitHub Copilot Agent. These apps demonstrate how generative AI can be used to build real-world .NET solutions leveraging AI as a co-pilot.

  - **First Sample: [SpaceAINet Console App](./05-AppCreatedWithGenAI/SpaceAINet/README.md)**
  **SpaceAINet** is an AI-powered Space Battle game for .NET 9, designed to showcase how modern AI models can play classic games. The solution allows you to run the game with either local AI models (via Ollama) or cloud-based models (via Azure AI Foundry), which analyze the game state and predict the next best action to win.
  Try it out and see how AI can master classic arcade gameplay!
  - **New Sample: [Console GPU Viewer](./05-AppCreatedWithGenAI/ConsoleGpuViewer/README.md)**
  A lightweight console utility that demonstrates GPU diagnostics and how to integrate local model runners or visual tooling into console-based .NET apps. Useful for testing GPU availability before running local inference models.

## üöÄ Introduction

Generative AI is transforming software development, and .NET is no exception. This course aims to simplify the journey by offering:

- Short 5-10 minute videos for each lesson.
- Fully functional .NET code samples you can run and explore.
- Integration with tools like **GitHub Codespaces** and **GitHub Models** for seamless setup and fast time-to-code. But if you want to run the samples locally with your own models, you can totally do that too.

You'll learn how to implement Generative AI into .NET projects, from basic text generation to building full-fledged solutions using **GitHub Models**, **Azure OpenAI Services** and **local models with Ollama**.

## üì¶ Each Lesson Includes

- **Short Video**: A quick overview of the lesson (5-10 minutes).
- **Complete Code Samples**: Fully functional and ready to run.
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Simple instructions to help you learn and implement the concepts.
- **Deep Dive References**: This course focuses on the practical implementation of GenAI, to get deeper into the theoretical we also provide links to explanations in [Generative AI for Beginners - A Course](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners) when needed.
