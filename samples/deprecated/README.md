# Deprecated Samples

> ⚠️ **These samples are archived and no longer actively maintained.**

The samples in this folder previously used **Microsoft Semantic Kernel** as their primary AI library. The course has migrated to **Microsoft.Extensions.AI (MEAI)** as the standard abstraction layer.

These samples are preserved for reference only. For current, maintained examples, see the parent `samples/` folder — particularly:

- **CoreSamples/BasicChat-01MEAI** — Chat with MEAI
- **CoreSamples/BasicChat-03Ollama** — Chat with Ollama via MEAI
- **CoreSamples/RAGSimple-02MEAIVectorsMemory** — RAG with MEAI VectorData
- **CoreSamples/MEAIFunctions** — Function calling with MEAI
