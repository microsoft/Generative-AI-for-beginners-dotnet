# Orchestration Log: Morpheus

**Agent:** Morpheus  
**Role:** Architectural lead & scope gate  
**Date:** 2026-02-23  
**Status:** 🔴 Decision: BLOCKED (awaiting fixes)

---

## Assignment

Synthesize Phase 1 findings from Oracle, Tank, and Trinity. Issue final architectural verdict on PR #491.

## Phase 1 Summary

| Finding | Source | Status | Severity |
|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| Changelog 95% accurate; root README gap acceptable | Oracle | ✅ APPROVE | Low |
| BasicChat-11FoundryClaude build failure (CS0234) | Tank | 🔴 REJECT | **CRITICAL** |
| Ambiguous Ollama language & duplicate What's New lines | Trinity | 🟡 CONDITIONAL APPROVE | Minor |

## Architectural Decision

**Final Verdict: 🔴 BLOCKED**

### Build Quality: REJECT (Critical Blocker)
- BasicChat-11FoundryClaude cannot build
- Systemic issue from SK deprecation cleanup
- Transitive dependency tracking insufficient
- **Required Action:** Add Azure.AI.OpenAI package reference
- **Risk if released:** Users cannot build/run this sample — unacceptable for course

### Documentation: CONDITIONAL APPROVE
- Fix ambiguous Ollama language (Line 59)
- Remove duplicate & restructure What's New section
- **All other docs excellent**

### Changelog: APPROVE
- 95% accurate overall
- Root README gap acceptable (optional follow-up PR)

## Blocking Conditions

Merge cannot proceed until:
1. ✅ Azure.AI.OpenAI added to BasicChat-11FoundryClaude.csproj
2. ✅ Build verified successful on that project
3. ✅ Ollama language clarified in RAG tutorial
4. ✅ What's New duplicates removed & structure fixed

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

**Prevent Future Occurrences:**
- Add CI rule: All projects with `using Azure.AI.*` must have explicit NuGet references
- Expand build verification to all non-deprecated samples (not spot-checks)
- Document transitive dependencies before package removal

## Handoff

Assignment issued to Neo (build fix) and Coordinator (documentation fixes). Phase 2 verification pending upon completion.

**Status:** ⏸️ AWAITING FIXES — Ready for Phase 2 upon completion
