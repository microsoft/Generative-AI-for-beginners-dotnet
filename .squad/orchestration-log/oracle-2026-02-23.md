## Assignment

Verify PR #491 changelog accuracy across:
- Commit hashes and file counts
- NuGet package versions
- Migration scope documentation

## Execution Summary

- ✅ Verified 8 commits against changelog entries
- ✅ Confirmed 74 .csproj file modifications
- ✅ Validated package version consistency (Microsoft.Extensions.AI 10.2.0, Azure.AI.OpenAI 2.8.0-beta.1)
- ✅ Tested 3 deprecated folder links (all functional)

## Findings

**Overall Accuracy:** 95%
- All commit hashes verified correct
- All file counts matched actual PR scope
- All versions documented accurately

**Minor Gap:** Root README.md "What's New" section does not include SK deprecation entry (only in `10-WhatsNew/readme.md`)

## Verdict

✅ **APPROVE** — Gap is acceptable by design. Detailed entry correctly placed in authoritative What's New section.

## Handoff

Oracle findings passed to Morpheus for architectural synthesis.
