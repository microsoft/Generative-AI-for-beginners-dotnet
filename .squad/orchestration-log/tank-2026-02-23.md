# Orchestration Log: Tank

**Agent:** Tank  
**Role:** Build verification & quality assessment  
**Date:** 2026-02-23  
**Status:** 🔴 Critical issue found (escalated)

---

## Assignment

Verify builds on 6 sample projects and assess NuGet consistency across PR #491:
- BasicChat-02SK (deprecated)
- BasicChat-05AIFoundryModels
- BasicChat-11FoundryClaude
- RAGSimple-02MEAIVectorsMemory
- MAF01
- BasicChat-01MEAI

## Execution Summary

- ✅ 5 of 6 projects build successfully
- ❌ 1 critical build failure: BasicChat-11FoundryClaude (CS0234 error)
- ✅ Verified NuGet version consistency (Microsoft.Extensions.AI 10.2.0 uniform across projects)
- ✅ Confirmed no rc.2 packages remain

## Critical Finding

**BasicChat-11FoundryClaude** fails with:
```
CS0234: The type or namespace name 'OpenAI' does not exist in the namespace 'Azure.AI'
```

**Root Cause:** Program.cs uses `Azure.AI.OpenAI` but the .csproj lacks explicit package reference. This was a transitive dependency from Semantic Kernel, which was removed.

**Solution Required:** Add `<PackageReference Include="Azure.AI.OpenAI" Version="2.8.0-beta.1" />`

## Verdict

🔴 **BLOCK MERGE** — Critical build failure must be fixed before PR can be merged.

## Handoff

Escalated to Morpheus for blocking decision. Neo assigned to apply fix.
