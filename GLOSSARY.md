# Generative AI for Beginners .NET - Glossary

This glossary defines technical terms used throughout the course. Terms are listed alphabetically for quick reference.

---

## A

### Agent
An AI system that can reason, plan, and take autonomous actions to accomplish goals. Unlike chatbots that only respond to questions, agents can use tools, maintain memory, and execute multi-step workflows. See [Lesson 4: AI Agents](./04-AgentsWithMAF/readme.md).

### Agent Framework
See [Microsoft Agent Framework](#microsoft-agent-framework-maf).

### AIAgent
The core class in Microsoft Agent Framework for creating AI agents. Created using the `CreateAIAgent` extension method on any `IChatClient`.

### AgentThread
A class in Microsoft Agent Framework that maintains conversation context across multiple agent runs. Similar to a conversation session.

### API Key
A secret credential used to authenticate requests to AI services. Never commit API keys to source control.

### Async/Await
C# keywords for asynchronous programming. Used throughout AI calls because model inference takes time.

### Azure OpenAI
Microsoft's enterprise-grade service for accessing OpenAI models (GPT-4, GPT-4o, etc.) with Azure security and compliance. See [Azure OpenAI Setup](./01-IntroductionToGenerativeAI/setup-azure-openai.md).

A single request-response interaction with an AI model. You send messages, the model returns a completion (response).

### ChatClientBuilder
A builder pattern class for creating middleware pipelines around `IChatClient`. Enables adding caching, telemetry, and custom behaviors.

### ChatMessage
A class representing a single message in a conversation. Contains a role (System, User, or Assistant) and content.

### ChatOptions
Configuration options for chat requests, including temperature, max tokens, and tool definitions.

### ChatRole
The role of a message sender. Three types:
- **System**: Sets the AI's behavior and personality
- **User**: Messages from the end user
- **Assistant**: Messages generated by the AI

### Chunking
The process of splitting large documents into smaller pieces for vector storage and retrieval. Important for RAG systems. See [RAG Lesson](./03-AIPatternsAndApplications/02-retrieval-augmented-generation.md).

### Context Window

### GitHub Models
A free tier service from GitHub that provides access to various AI models (GPT-4o, Phi-4, etc.) for development and testing.

### Grounding
Providing an AI model with specific context or data to base its responses on. Reduces hallucinations and improves accuracy.

---

## H

### Hallucination
When an AI model generates plausible-sounding but incorrect or fabricated information. Mitigated by grounding with RAG or verified data.

---

## I

### IChatClient
*Pronounced: "Eye-Chat-Client"*

The unified .NET interface for interacting with any AI chat provider. Part of Microsoft.Extensions.AI. Works with Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, Ollama, GitHub Models, and more.

### IEmbeddingGenerator
The .NET interface for generating embeddings from text. Part of Microsoft.Extensions.AI.

### Inference
The process of running an AI model to generate predictions or responses. When you call an AI model, you're running inference.

---

## J

### JSON Mode
A setting that instructs the AI model to return responses as valid JSON. Related to structured output.

---

## L

### Large Language Model (LLM)
*Pronounced: "El-El-Em"*

A neural network trained on massive text datasets that can generate human-like text. Examples: GPT-4, Claude, Llama. See [Lesson 1](./01-IntroductionToGenerativeAI/readme.md).

### Latency
The time delay between sending a request and receiving a response. Streaming reduces perceived latency.

---

## M

### MEAI
*Pronounced: "ME-AI"*

Abbreviation for [Microsoft.Extensions.AI](#microsoftextensionsai).

### Microsoft.Extensions.AI
*Abbreviation: MEAI*

A unified abstraction layer for AI in .NET. Provides `IChatClient` and `IEmbeddingGenerator` interfaces that work with any AI provider. The foundation of this course.

### Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)
An open-source SDK for building AI agents in .NET. Unifies Semantic Kernel and AutoGen concepts. Supports single agents and multi-agent workflows. See [Lesson 4](./04-AgentsWithMAF/readme.md).

### MCP
*Pronounced: "M-C-P"*

See [Model Context Protocol](#model-context-protocol-mcp).

### Middleware
Software components that wrap other components to add functionality. In this course, middleware adds caching, telemetry, and custom behaviors to `IChatClient`.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
*Abbreviation: MCP*

A standardized protocol for AI models to access external tools and data sources. Enables agents to interact with files, databases, APIs, and more. See [MCP Lesson](./04-AgentsWithMAF/04-model-context-protocol.md).

### SLM (Small Language Model)
*Pronounced: "S-L-M"*

A language model optimized for efficiency and on-device execution. Examples: Phi-4, Phi-4-mini. Smaller than LLMs but still capable for many tasks.

### Streaming
Receiving AI responses incrementally as they're generated, rather than waiting for the complete response. Improves perceived responsiveness. Uses `IAsyncEnumerable<ChatResponseUpdate>`.

### Structured Output
AI responses in a predefined format (JSON, typed objects) rather than free-form text. Enables programmatic processing of AI responses. See [Structured Output Lesson](./02-GenerativeAITechniques/02-streaming-structured-output.md).

### System Message
The first message in a conversation that sets the AI's behavior, personality, and constraints. Only visible to the model, not the user.

---

## T

### Temperature
A parameter that controls randomness in AI responses. Low (0.0-0.3) = more focused and deterministic. High (0.7-1.0) = more creative and varied.

### Token
The basic unit of text for AI models. A token is typically a word or word piece. "Hello, world!" is approximately 4 tokens. Token limits affect both input and output.

### Tool
In AI context, a function or capability that an agent can use. Examples: web search, calculator, database query. Defined using function calling or MCP.
