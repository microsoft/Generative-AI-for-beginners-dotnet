# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to
agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to,
and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit
<https://cla.microsoft.com>.

> Important: when translating text in this repo, please ensure that you do not use machine translation. We will verify translations via the community, so please only volunteer for translations in languages where you are proficient.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need
to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the
instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

## Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst).
For more information read the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.

## Question or Problem?

Please do not open GitHub issues for general support questions as the GitHub list should be used for feature requests and bug reports. This way we can more easily track actual issues or bugs from the code and keep the general discussion separate from the actual code.

## Typos, Issues, Bugs and contributions

Whenever you are submitting any changes to the Generative AI for Beginners repository, please follow these recommendations.

* Always fork the repository to your own account before making your modifications
* Do not combine multiple changes to one pull request. For example, submit any bug fix and documentation updates using separate PRs
* If your pull request shows merge conflicts, make sure to update your local main to be a mirror of what's in the main repository before making your modifications
* If you are submitting a translation, please create one PR for all the translated files as we don't accept partial translations for the content
* If you are submitting a typo or documentation fix, you can combine modifications to a single PR where suitable
