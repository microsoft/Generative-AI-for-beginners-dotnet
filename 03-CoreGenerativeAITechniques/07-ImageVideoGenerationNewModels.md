## Image and Video Generation with New Azure OpenAI Models

Image and video generation AI represents the next frontier in creative applications. Using the latest models like `gpt-image-1` for images and `sora` for videos through Azure OpenAI, you can create high-quality visual content from text descriptions. These new models offer improved quality, better understanding of complex prompts, and enhanced creative capabilities.

### Image Generation with gpt-image-1

The `gpt-image-1` model represents a significant advancement in image generation capabilities. Let's explore how to use it in a .NET application:

> üßë‚Äçüíª**Sample code**: [Here is a working example of this application](../../samples/CoreGenerativeAITechniques/ImageGeneration-01/) you can follow along with.

#### How to run the sample code

To run the sample code, you'll need to:

1. Make sure you have set up a GitHub Codespace with the appropriate environment as described in the [Setup guide](../02-SetupDevEnvironment/readme.md)
2. Ensure you have configured your Azure OpenAI API key and settings as described in the [Azure OpenAI setup guide](../02-SetupDevEnvironment/getting-started-azure-openai.md)
3. Open a terminal in your codespace (Ctrl+` or Cmd+`)
4. Navigate to the sample code directory:
   ```bash
   cd 03-CoreGenerativeAITechniques/src/ImageGeneration-01
   ```
5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

#### Setting up the Azure OpenAI Client for gpt-image-1

First, we need to set up our configuration and create an Azure OpenAI client specifically for the `gpt-image-1` model:

```csharp
var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder().AddUserSecrets<Program>();
var configuration = builder.Build();

var model = configuration["model"]; // Set to "gpt-image-1" in your configuration
var url = configuration["api_url"];
var apiKey = configuration["api_key"];

AzureOpenAIClient azureClient = new(new Uri(url), new System.ClientModel.ApiKeyCredential(apiKey));
var client = azureClient.GetImageClient(model);
```

In this code:

1. We load the configuration from user secrets

1. We extract the model name (should be "gpt-image-1"), API URL, and API key from the configuration

1. We create an Azure OpenAI client using the URL and API key

1. We get an image client specifically for the `gpt-image-1` model

#### Creating Advanced Prompts and Options

The `gpt-image-1` model supports more sophisticated prompts and enhanced options:

```csharp
string prompt = "A kitten playing soccer in the moon. Use a comic style";

// generate an image using the prompt with advanced options
ImageGenerationOptions options = new()
{
    Size = GeneratedImageSize.W1024xH1024,
    Quality = "medium"
};
```

The `gpt-image-1` model provides:

- Enhanced understanding of complex prompts
- Better style interpretation
- Improved image quality and consistency
- More accurate object placement and composition

#### Generating and Processing the Image

With our client, prompt, and options configured for `gpt-image-1`, we can generate the image:

```csharp
GeneratedImage image = await client.GenerateImageAsync(prompt, options);

// Save the image to a file
string path = $"{Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.Desktop)}/genimage{DateTimeOffset.Now.Ticks}.png";
File.WriteAllBytes(path, image.ImageBytes.ToArray());
```

This code:

1. Calls the `GenerateImageAsync` method with our prompt and options
2. Creates a file path on the desktop with a unique filename
3. Saves the generated image bytes to the file

### Video Generation with Sora

The `sora` model enables video generation from text prompts, bringing motion and temporal dynamics to your AI-generated content. Let's explore how to use it:

> üßë‚Äçüíª**Sample code**: [Here are working examples for video generation](../../samples/CoreGenerativeAITechniques/VideoGeneration-AzureSora-01/) and [using the AzureSoraSDK](../../samples/CoreGenerativeAITechniques/VideoGeneration-AzureSoraSDK-02/) you can follow along with.

#### Using REST API Approach

The first approach uses direct REST API calls to interact with the Sora model:

```csharp
// Configuration setup
var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder().AddUserSecrets<Program>();
var configuration = builder.Build();
string endpoint = configuration["endpoint"];
string apiKey = configuration["api_key"];
string model = "sora";

// HTTP client setup
var client = new HttpClient();
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("api-key", apiKey);
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));
```

#### Creating a Video Generation Job

To generate a video with Sora, we first create a video generation job:

```csharp
string prompt = "Two puppies playing soccer in the moon. Use a cartoon style.";

// Create a video generation job
string createUrl = $"{endpoint}/openai/v1/video/generations/jobs?api-version=preview";
var body = new
{
    prompt = prompt,
    width = 480,
    height = 480,
    n_seconds = 5,
    model = model
};

var bodyJson = JsonSerializer.Serialize(body);
var response = await client.PostAsync(createUrl, new StringContent(bodyJson, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json"));
response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();

var responseJson = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
using var doc = JsonDocument.Parse(responseJson);
string jobId = doc.RootElement.GetProperty("id").GetString();
```

#### Polling for Job Completion

Video generation takes time, so we need to poll for the job status:

```csharp
// Poll for job status
string statusUrl = $"{endpoint}/openai/v1/video/generations/jobs/{jobId}?api-version=preview";
string status = null;
JsonElement statusResponse = default;

do
{
    await Task.Delay(5000); // Wait 5 seconds between polls
    var statusResp = await client.GetAsync(statusUrl);
    var statusJson = await statusResp.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    var statusDoc = JsonDocument.Parse(statusJson);
    statusResponse = statusDoc.RootElement;
    status = statusResponse.GetProperty("status").GetString();
    Console.WriteLine($"{DateTime.Now:dd-MMM-yyyy HH:mm:ss} Job status: {status}");
} while (status != "succeeded" && status != "failed" && status != "cancelled");
```

#### Downloading the Generated Video

Once the job succeeds, we can download the generated video:

```csharp
if (status == "succeeded")
{
    string generationId = statusResponse.GetProperty("generations")[0].GetProperty("id").GetString();
    string videoUrl = $"{endpoint}/openai/v1/video/generations/{generationId}/content/video?api-version=preview";
    
    var videoResp = await client.GetAsync(videoUrl);
    if (videoResp.IsSuccessStatusCode)
    {
        string outputFilename = Path.Combine(outputDir, $"sora_{DateTime.Now:ddMMMyyyy_HHmmss}.mp4");
        using (var fs = new FileStream(outputFilename, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write))
        {
            await videoResp.Content.CopyToAsync(fs);
        }
        Console.WriteLine($"SORA Generated video saved: '{outputFilename}'");
    }
}
```


#### Using AzureSoraSDK (Alternative Approach)

For a more streamlined experience, you can use the [AzureSoraSDK](https://github.com/DrHazemAli/AzureSoraSDK) by [DrHazemAli](https://github.com/DrHazemAli). **Note:** This is *not* an official SDK from Microsoft or OpenAI, but it works well and provides a convenient way to generate videos with Sora in .NET applications.

```csharp
// Configure the client
var options = new SoraClientOptions
{
    Endpoint = endpoint,
    ApiKey = apiKey,
    DeploymentName = "sora",
    ApiVersion = "preview"
};

// Create client
using var client = new SoraClient(options.Endpoint, options.ApiKey, options.DeploymentName);

// Submit video generation job
var jobId = await client.SubmitVideoJobAsync(
    prompt: "A serene waterfall in a lush forest with sunlight filtering through trees",
    width: 1280,
    height: 720,
    nSeconds: 10);

// Wait for completion and download
var videoUri = await client.WaitForCompletionAsync(jobId);
var outputPath = Path.Combine(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.Desktop), "sora_videos", "output.mp4");
await client.DownloadVideoAsync(videoUri, outputPath);
